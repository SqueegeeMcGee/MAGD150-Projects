# Welcome to Makai DeLorme's code portfolio
This is a collection of five assignments done throughout Spring '19's MAGD150 class, plus a bonus. The following will be brief descriptions of each article of code.

### [s19magd150lab01_DeLorme](https://github.com/SqueegeeMcGee/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab01_DeLorme) ; "Space Sketch"
  This was the first assignment of the semester, a simple but tedious list of white ellipses, forming stars and some incidental "constellations" across a solar system. The orbital ellipses was my favorite section of code to write, since it was easy and turned out nicely on the first attempt.

### [s19magd150lab02_DeLorme](https://github.com/SqueegeeMcGee/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab02_DeLorme) ; "Color Composition"
  The second assignment of the semester, involving simple use of colors. This instance of the code was uploaded after being edited for the Lab 10 assignment involving 3D meshes, and thus doesn't have the same.. _visual clarity_ that the original version did. 
  Admittedly, I could download the .zip that was uploaded to Canvas and reupload it here - but not only do I not know how to delete duplicate files on Github, this folder already mysteriously separated while renaming it. The _folder which properly capitalizes_ my name is the only one with actual code. The other is the .png used in Lab 10.

### [s19magd150lab03_DeLorme](https://github.com/SqueegeeMcGee/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab03_DeLorme) ; "Screensaver"
  The third assignment of the semester, creating a simple draw() function.I created several neon ellipses which follow the mouse's X and Y coordinates, as well as some bezier curves which generate when the **LMB** is clicked. The neon-on-black aesthetic was meant to simulate a 90s screensaver. I could imagine designing a 3D Pipe screensaver in Processing being equal parts fun and infuriating.
  
### [s19magd150lab09_DeLorme](https://github.com/SqueegeeMcGee/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab09_DeLorme) ; "Movie Documentary"
  The penultimate (lab) assignment of the semester. This one involved basic video and audio coding. In my case, I loaded a Sekiro clip into Processing, with a border designed in Paint, and a brief voice clip mocking documentary commentary. If I recall, this code was not entirely functional by the time we deemed it complete.
  
### [s19magd150lab10_DeLorme](https://github.com/SqueegeeMcGee/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab10_DeLorme) ; "3D Imaging"
  The final (lab) assignment of the semester. Using a .png sourced from the Lab 2 code, a mesh was made and textured, featured alongside some 3D primitives, a few light sources, and an adjustable camera. The light colors can be randomized with a click of the **LMB**, and the camera can be moved using either WASD or the arrow keys.
  
  **BONUS**
### [s19magd150lab03_DeLorme](https://github.com/SqueegeeMcGee/MAGD150-Projects/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150processEcho_HallDeLorme) ; "Project ECHO "
  This is among the more complex code in the group, thanks to the help of Jake, who coded the more difficult sections in a timely manner. I assisted with rephrasing tedious sections of code, troubleshooting, brainstorming, and visual design of the game. I also found the source code used for the title screen and created the title screen graphic. The game itself consists of a main tab, two class tabs, and a title screen graphic (which should be in a "data" folder). The goal of the game is to move through a pitch-black maze through the use of "sound waves", represented by a spread of ellipses _with collision_ sent out from the player's position.
